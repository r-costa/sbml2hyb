# SBML2HYB
## Overview
sbml2hyb is an stand-alone executable application for [SBML](https://synonym.caltech.edu/) compatible hybrid modelling. The tool is written in Python and can be used for converting between SBML format and HMOD (intermediate format â€” enabling communication between the essential components of the mechanistic and hybrid models). See [HMOD](https://github.com/rs-costa/sbml2hyb/blob/main/models/chassagnole1hyb.hmod) file example.

## Installation and Usage
Can be easily installed using the executable file ([.exe](https://github.com/rs-costa/sbml2hyb/raw/main/exe/SBML2HYB.exe)) and double-click. Please make sure to check that you download the [folder](https://github.com/rs-costa/sbml2hyb/tree/main/exe) containing the executable file and the logo.
Once the simple Graphical User Interface (GUI) window opens, click the "Translate SBML" or "Translate HMOD" button, to find the SBML or HMOD file you want to convert, respectively.  After few seconds, the user get the final output in the panel of the GUI. The user can then save (click "export file" button) the final file (.xml or .hmod).
