Welcome to the documentation for SBML2HYB
=======================================================

The sbml2hyb tool is an stand-alone executable application for SBML compatible hybrid modelling. The tool is written in Python and is intended as an interface to convert existing `SBML
<http://www.sbml.org>`_ models into a hybrid model (combines mechanistic equations and ML techniques). Below see the proposed pipeline in Figure 1.
The new internal hybrid model format HMOD (intermediate format â€” enables communication between the essential components of the mechanistic and hybrid models) can be translated to SBML and vice-versa. See `HMOD
<https://github.com/rs-costa/sbml2hyb/blob/main/models/chassagnole1standard.hmod>`_ format example.

Using SBML2HYB
--------
Here is an example of a SBML hybrid model (`Chassagnole 
<https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/BIOMD0000000066#Overview>`_ case study) built with **sbml2hyb**:

After launching sbml2hyb (see installation instructions), the following graphical user interface (GUI) will be open (Figure 2).
Once the simple GUI window opens, click the "*Translate SBML file*" button (see Figure 2), and browse to specify the SBML model file (here the mechanistic model example is taken from Biomodels database, `BIOMD0000000066
<https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/model/download/BIOMD0000000066.2?filename=BIOMD0000000066_url.xml>`_) you want to convert.
Add then the information of the neural network component into the model (click "*Add ML*" button). Once you do this, select the "*Inputs*" (select all) and "*Outputs*" (vm5, vm4f, vm3f, vm2f, vm11, knadph and katpase) options, and the `Keras <https://github.com/r-costa/sbml2hyb/blob/main/models/Chass_Keras.h5>`_ neural network file for this case study (Figure 3) to be added to the mechanistic model. After this, click the "*Confirm*" buttons. Note: To generate the Keras H5 file that serves as a blueprint of the machine learning segment of the hybrid model, follow this `instructions <https://github.com/rs-costa/sbml2hyb/blob/main/models/keras_H5/instructions_createH5.txt>`_ or this example as `notebook <https://github.com/rs-costa/sbml2hyb/blob/main/models/keras_H5/create_keras_h5.ipynb>`_.
Finally, the hybrid model generated in HMOD format is reconverted in SBML by clicking the "*Translate HMOD file*" button and then "*Confirm*" button (Figure 4). 
To save the final hybrid SBML model file, click "*Save file*" button (Figure 5).
