# Case Studies - Examples 

This folder contains the "Chassagnole" model, files that contain "chassgnole" in the name, and "Park&Ramirez" model, files that contain "parkram" in the name. 
Both of the provided mechanistic original models (chassagnole1standard and parkramstandard) in .xml and .hmod format are used as examples to test the tool. We also provide the hybrid models before (chassagnole1hyb and parkramhyb) and after (chassagnole1hyb_trained.xml and parkramhyb_trained.xml) trained for both of these models. 
Additionally, the Keras H5 files (i.e., the ML component information to be added to the mechanistic model) are also provided (Chass_Keras.h5 and Park_Keras.h5).

The sub-folder "keras_H5" contains information and code on how to create the Keras H5 file component.
